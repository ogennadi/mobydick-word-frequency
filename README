WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON WORDS USED IN MOBY DICK?

To find out, you'll need to have Racket 6.11 installed. Then execute this command in the source directory

    racket main.rkt



HOW DO I KNOW THAT THOSE REALLY ARE THE MOST COMMON WORDS?

To find out, you'll need to have R 3.4 installed. Start the R interpreter, install the required packages, then exit back to the shell with

    $ R
    > install.packages(c('dplyr', 'stringr', 'tidytext'))
    > q()

Run this command to find the most common words using R (the output appears in `word-frequency.csv`.

    Rscript test.R

Now run the Racket test program to compare the answers generated by R with those generated by Racket.

    racket test.rkt

If everything goes well, the test program should end with no output.
