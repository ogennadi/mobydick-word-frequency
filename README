WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON WORDS USED IN MOBY DICK?

To find out, you'll need to have Racket 6.11 installed. Then execute this command in the source directory

    racket main.rkt



HOW DO I KNOW THAT THOSE REALLY ARE THE MOST COMMON WORDS?

To find out, you'll need to have R 3.4 installed along with the following packages

    dplyr
    stringr
    tidytext

Run this command to find the most common words using R (the output appears in `word-frequency.csv`.

    Rscript test.R

Now run the Racket test progra to compare the answers generated by R with those generated by Racket.

    racket test.rkt

If everything goes well, the test program should end with no output.
